# About This Project  
This is java based client-server socket application. The client can input his name, weight, and height then send it to server. The server process client's input to calculate client's BMI (Body Mass Index) then send it back to client.

# What I learn  
- Basic socket programming in Java CLI application
- Java socket.isClosed() only checks if we already closed the socket, not if the socket is actually closed by the other.

# How to
1. Compile using `javac ./Client.java && javac ./Server.java`
2. Run the app using `java` -- TODO
